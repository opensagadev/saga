This is a decompilation of _LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga_, based on the
Android x86 release. The repository builds three variants:

| Variant  | Purpose                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `target` | Android x86 shared library used for binary matching |
| `native` | Linux or Windows diagnostic executable              |
| `wasm`   | Browser diagnostic build                            |

Game assets and the original binary are not included or required to compile.

## Build 🔨

You need Git and an x86-64 Linux C/C++ toolchain. The Linux `native`
variant uses system libraries: it needs your distribution's
32-bit SDL 3, Vorbis, EGL, GLES, and `pkg-config` development support. Bazel
downloads the toolchains and libraries used by `target` and `wasm`.

Install Bazelisk as `bazel` and it will select the version in `.bazelversion`.
Alternatively, install that Bazel version directly.

Clone and build every variant:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ttdecomp/saga.git
cd saga

bazel build --config=target //src:saga_target
bazel build --config=native //src:saga_native
bazel build --config=wasm //src:saga_wasm
bazel test //scripts/checks:checks
```

Optimized, sanitizer-free host builds are available as
`--config=native_release` and `--config=wasm_release`; both compile with
`-O2`.

To run the native or browser build after supplying your own game assets, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md):

```sh
bazel run --config=native //src:run_native -- window
bazel run --config=wasm //scripts:wasm_server
```
