# Bazel implementation reference

> Agent/reference document. Use [`README.md`](../README.md) for a first build
> and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for human development workflows.

## Toolchains

- Bazel 9.2.0 is pinned by `.bazelversion`.
- `rules_python` supplies Python 3.12.12 to all declared Python targets.
- The matching target uses Android NDK r8e GCC 4.7, API 9, and x86.
- Native Linux intentionally uses i686 with ASan and UBSan.
- Native Windows is i686, cross-compiled on Linux x86-64 with the pinned
  llvm-mingw clang/lld toolchain (`@llvm_mingw`) selected by
  `--config=windows-i686`. Its wrapper (`bazel/llvm_mingw_cc.sh`) prefixes
  asm-label symbols with the `_` that i686 Windows expects.
  `u64`, `i64` and `f64` are 4-byte aligned there and bit-fields use the GCC
  layout, so the `DECOMP_ASSERT` layout checks hold as on Android.
- WASM uses emsdk 6.0.8 and a pthread-enabled Emscripten toolchain.

The NDK repository can use an existing absolute `SAGA_NDK_R8E` path. Without
it, the repository rule downloads and verifies NDK r8e. Its host tools support
x86-64 Linux, Windows, and macOS; Apple Silicon needs Rosetta for this target.

## Dependencies

The matching target builds Ogg 1.2.1, Vorbis 1.3.2, and Squish 1.10
hermetically. WASM uses Ogg 1.3.6, Vorbis 1.3.7, Squish 1.10, and SDL 3.4.10.
Native Linux and macOS builds discover SDL3, Vorbis/Vorbisfile, and EGL/GLES2
through pkg-config. Native Windows uses pinned MSYS2 i686 packages of SDL3 and
ANGLE (`@windows_i686_deps`) and the WASM Ogg/Vorbis sources. Squish remains
hermetic.

## Preserved target behavior

- All variants use C11/C++11 and disable C++ exceptions and RTTI.
- `native` and `wasm` define both `HOST_BUILD` and `ANDROID`.
- The matching target disables function and data sections.
- Per-file `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`, and `-fPIE` overrides live in
  `bazel/android_per_file_copts.bazelrc`.
- `src/BUILD.bazel` is the source-membership authority.
- `//src:run_native` restores `BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY` before executing the
  native binary.
- Python tools should be run by Bazel label. Direct `python3` bypasses the
  pinned runtime.

Inspect effective target commands with:

```sh
bazel aquery --config=target \
  'mnemonic("CppCompile", deps(//src:saga_target))' --output=commands
```

The supported labels, host prerequisites, output paths, and CI matrix are kept
in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) rather than duplicated here.
