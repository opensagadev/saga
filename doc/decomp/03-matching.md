# 03 — Matching and verification

> Agent/reference document. Human matching workflows are in
> [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

The matching workflow compares the original Android x86 shared object with the
shared object produced by Bazel. Matching remains a whole-binary comparison;
the repository also generates a GitHub Pages summary by mapping Bazel compile
actions and object symbols back to translation units. It does not require or
generate split target binaries.

## Terminology

- **target build**: the reconstructed Android x86 `libTTapp.so`.
- **original**: the reference binary at `res/libTTapp.so`.
- **base/current**: the newly built `bazel-bin/src/libTTapp.so` in objdiff
  terminology.
- **native build**: the Linux or Windows executable used for runtime
  diagnostics. It is not the matching artifact.

## Build and repository checks

```bash
bazel build --config=target //src:saga_target
bazel test //scripts/checks:checks
```

The target build preserves the NDK r8e compiler, API 9 sysroot, source list,
and per-file optimization levels. `bazel/android_per_file_copts.bazelrc` is the
optimization authority; absence of an override means `-O0`.

The repository test suite currently checks:

- source membership and the boundary between engine and native-only code;
- every target optimization override, including missing files and duplicate or
  invalid optimization assignments.

## Compare one symbol

With `objdiff-cli` available on `PATH`:

```bash
bazel run //scripts:objdiff_cli -- _Z5qrandv
```

The helper runs objdiff directly against the two complete shared objects. Its
left side is the original and its right side is the current build. Read `-` and
`~` lines as behavior present in the original, and `+` and `>` lines as code
emitted by the current build.

For a dependency-free symbol-table or raw-disassembly check, use the NDK tools
described in [08-asm-review.md](08-asm-review.md).

## Check symbol coverage

When the original binary is present:

```bash
bazel run //scripts/checks:check_symbols
```

This compares defined text symbols in the original and current shared objects,
applies `scripts/checks/symbols_ignore.txt`, and enforces the documented exact
extra-symbol baseline. It is a diagnostic for symbol coverage; byte matching
still requires instruction comparison.

## Matching reports

With `res/libTTapp.so` present and `objdiff-cli` on `PATH`, regenerate the
committed Pages data and visualization with:

```bash
bazel build --config=target //src:saga_target
bazel run //scripts:generate_bazel_objdiff_report
bazel run //scripts:plot_binary_match_map
```

The first generator runs one whole-binary objdiff comparison and writes
`matching.json`; the second renders `doc/pages/index.html`.
Bazel does not generate split target objects or `report.json`.

For manual exploration in the objdiff GUI, generate the ignored project file:

```bash
bazel run //scripts:generate_objdiff_gui_config
objdiff -p .
```

This `objdiff.json` is GUI-only. It uses the same Bazel action query as the
matching report to create one entry per source/object unit; each current object
is compared with the complete original library. It is not an input to
reporting, hooks, or CI.

## Resolved comparison (experimental)

The project's objdiff fork recovers some PIC-relative operands in the linked
libraries: the GOT-base `add` after a PC thunk, loads from GOT slots, and `lea`
of an address covered by exactly one named symbol. It still compares other
`GOTOFF` displacements as numbers: loads and stores of globals and statics,
SSE and x87 constants, string literals without a unique label, indexed
operands, and every operand of a function that contains a jump table. Each
displacement is the distance from the GOT to a `.rodata`, `.data` or `.bss`
item, so such a function still scores just under 100% until the data layout of
the whole binary matches. To see how much of the remaining difference is only
layout, run:

```bash
bazel build --config=target //src:saga_target
bazel run //scripts:resolved_match_report
```

The report resolves each differing PIC-relative operand in both libraries and
accepts it when both refer to the same symbol and offset in the same section
(`.data` and `.bss` differ), a GOT slot for such a symbol, identical constant
bytes, the same string, an identical compiler-generated table, or a jump table
with the same case offsets. Anonymous literals are compared by content, not by
their `.LCn` label: the number only records where the literal was first used in
its unit, so equal labels can hold different strings. Branches compare targets
by symbol, ignoring clone numbering. Everything else must be textually
identical with the same instruction count, so the check is somewhat stricter
than objdiff where it applies: of objdiff's exact functions only those calling
a different compiler clone, or loading different data, fail it.

It also lists near-exact functions whose resolved data differs: wrong
constants, strings, globals, data sections and field offsets that raw
displacements cannot distinguish from layout. This is a diagnostic;
`matching.json`, the README progress table and CI still use objdiff's score.

## Common pitfalls

1. A function can have the right behavior and still compile differently because
   its signature, linkage, source order, or optimization level differs.
2. `int` and `long` are both 32-bit in this ABI but have different C++ mangled
   names. Use the ABI types documented in [04-types-abi.md](04-types-abi.md).
3. Moving a function between files can change its optimization level. Compare
   the source and destination entries in
   `bazel/android_per_file_copts.bazelrc` first.
4. `HOST_BUILD` code is for native/WASM diagnostics and must not leak into the
   matching target.
5. The target is a shared object with no `main`; only native and WASM builds use
   the host harness.

## Authoring loop

1. Confirm the exact original symbol name with `nm`.
2. Locate its source owner with `rg`.
3. Confirm the file's effective target options with `bazel aquery`.
4. Implement the smallest source change that matches the ABI and expected
   code-generation pattern.
5. Rebuild `//src:saga_target`, compare the symbol, and run
   `bazel test //scripts/checks:checks`.
