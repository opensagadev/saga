Run the complete fast suite with:

```sh
bazel test //scripts/checks:checks
```

The suite runs the three source-only checks. The symbol check runs after the
target build in both the pre-commit hook and CI; invoke it manually with:

```sh
bazel run //scripts/checks:check_symbols -- --list
```

Run clang-tidy for the three build modes with:

```sh
bazel build --config=target //src:clang_tidy_target
bazel build --config=native //src:clang_tidy_native
bazel build --config=native_release //src:clang_tidy_native
bazel build --config=wasm //src:clang_tidy_wasm
bazel build --config=wasm_release //src:clang_tidy_wasm
```

These targets attach clang-tidy directly to the configured Bazel C/C++ targets.
Bazel downloads the pinned clang-tidy executable and supplies each target's
defines, headers, and toolchain flags. The pre-commit hook runs only modes
supported by the host; CI runs all three on Linux.

CI supplies `--original-symbols matching.json`, whose symbol surface
is generated from the local reference ELF alongside the Pages report.

| File | Kind | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `check_bazel_optimization_map.py` | automatic `py_test` | Every Android per-file optimization mapping is exact, valid, and points to an existing source. |
| `check_host_boundary.py` | automatic `py_test` | Shared source does not include host-only code or add unapproved `HOST_BUILD` forks. |
| `check_duplicate_definitions.py` | automatic `py_test` | Duplicate C/C++ type definitions, plus optional duplicate object symbols. |
| `check_symbols.py` | post-build `py_binary` | Missing and unexpected text symbols relative to the original symbol surface; calls an NDK-compatible `nm`. |
| `check_save_utility.py` | manual native integration check | Run with the native executable path; checks original save offsets, enum flags, schema byte coverage, creation/editing, lossless export/import, checksum maintenance, and rejected-input preservation. |
| `check_smoke_utility.py` | manual Linux integration check | Run with the smoke executable path; checks invalid saves/arguments, watchdog timeouts, direct gameplay startup and fixture preservation. Requires the OBB and an X display. |
| `BUILD.bazel` lint tools | support targets | Exposes Bazel-downloaded `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` executables without wrapper scripts. |
| `linters.bzl` | three manual lint targets in `src/BUILD.bazel` | Defines the Bazel clang-tidy aspect used by the target, native, and WASM builds. |
| `symbols_ignore.txt`, `symbols_extra_baseline.txt` | support data | Documented symbol exceptions and the exact allowed extra-symbol set. |

Shared Python code that is not an executable lives in `scripts/lib/`.
`scripts/lib/ndk_tools.py` locates prefixed, LLVM, or host tool variants for
the duplicate-symbol and symbol-surface checks.
